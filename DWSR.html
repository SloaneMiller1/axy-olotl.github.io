      note to self, I cannot cast any spells involving dead things inside unless I clean the entire apartment.
      Failure to do so results in swarms of flies, gnats and mosquitoes as well as a mouse that worries me quite a bit.

      Nothing about today is good. Somehow! Someway! my simple spell that would summon a ghost servant got combined with one of Melodies "Blood Trees"
      (I dont know what they are either thats what she calls them) and now the entire apartment is full of red smoke we cant get rid of and its sparking and making lightning like its own person storm
      IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CONTROL OR NUETRALIZE THE SPELL PLEASE LET ME KNOW CAUSE THE BOTH OF US ARE HUDDLED OUTSIDE PANICKING!!!!

  <strong>  Update 9: </strong>
    Heeeeeeeeeey Internet...So it you saw the above update then you know our current situation and I'd like to inform we that we figured out what happened.
    So the good news is that as it
    turns out Ursa messes up her summoning signil and when it combined with my Blood Trees(AKA Friend Trees!) the result was a summoning spell of a demon!
    With that figured out we just threw an old doll inside the middle of the storm so the demon could be contained!
    The Bad News is the old doll was an old containment project of Ursa's and now the doll is shaped like a smol human person and we cant unsummon the demon...or destroy it.
    But hey at least now we know what not to do when using that spell!
    If you've got any information for sending the little demon back home it would be a big help cause its pretty grouchy and currently trashing our room.

  <strong>  Update 11: </strong>
    An update on the situation! The little demons' name is Anacar. They don't like being called little though. At current it seems they're cut off from most of their powers
    which means they aren't that dangerous!
    They're also susprisingly nice...from a demon and he likes Noodle so I think he's alright.
    Until we can get him back home I offered to let him live on our couch! Hopefully this'll turn out alright.
    I think Ursa is a little angry about the situation, but hey it was her doll that got Anacar trapped ;)

  ....Melodie has befriended the demon....and now it lives in the living room.....what did I do to deserve this???? I knew Melodie was friendly but this is just
  Fricking INSANE! Melodie if you read any of my updates I want you to know that I currently think you're insane and I'm still gonna try to get rid of that thing!

    <img src="kiwi.jpg" style="width:30px;height:30px;">
  <strong>  Blood Trees Explained: </strong>
  A blood tree is a special spell I'm working on prefecting. Basically, I take soething with my friends essence (Old Clothes, Hair ties) and some of their DNA (Hair or Blood but mostly hair).
I then combine them into a seed and plant to seed and it grows into a mini bonsai style that shares my friends personaility traits and looks (hair color and skin color is reflected in the bark and leaves).
ALl and all the process is still kinda shakely but I think its fun.:)

 I am going to kill Ancar. I'm not joking this time I swear to god I am going to kill this damn demon.
 If you remeber the hellhounds incident we had about a month ago we all agreed that no pets would be allowed in the apartment with the exception of familars.
 So what does this moron decide to do? Buy a 120 lb dog and attempt to hide it from me...in my and Melodie's room!
 He then attempted to distract us from going into our room by trashing the kitchen,
 bathroom and almost throwing a toaster out the window before we got him on the demon trap rug and in a timeout.
  at which point we opened the door to our room and were greeted with the sight of a gaint sized noodle smacking a fully grown golden retriever
  that was using them as a chew toy.
