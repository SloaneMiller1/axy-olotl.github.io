<strong>  Update 1: </strong>
  Hello internet world! Recently my new roommate and I decided it would be amazing to create an online blog and youtube channel to talk and give life
  updates!

<div class= "textmelodie" </div>
  <strong>  Update 2:</strong>
  My roommates aren't human....They are so far from human that one is a LITERAL DEMON.
  How I didn't know about this sooner I...I dont know.
  To give a quick crash course view of yesterday after my first update
  I got to the apartment about an hour after that first update.
  I'd already known that one of my roommates was a witch however i was unaware of the mere existance of the other until he...they..he, blasted flames from the sink
  In retalitation of being forced to do the dishes.
  At that point I'm pretty sure I fainted cause I woke up on the couch around midnight with the demon staring me down.
  He calls himself Ancar and the witch Ursa.
  Ursa then spent the next 30 minutes apologizing for not telling me about him and then explaining the rooming situation.
  I'll be sharing a room with her but she put up a divider wall for privacy and all of us share a shower/tub but theres a second bathroom with a sink and toilet
  She's also ensured me that Ancar won't kill me but Im not sure how much I believe her

  <strong>  Update 13:  </strong>
  Ancar has a time out rug now, we spray painted a demon trap on it and made it a time out rug. its existed for 6 hours and he's already been in it twice
  end of update
</div>
</p>

<div class= "textanacar" </div>
 <strong> Update 36: </strong>
 I am going to kill Ancar. I'm not joking this time I swear to god I am going to kill this damn demon.
 If you remeber the hellhounds incident we had about a month ago we all agreed that no pets would be allowed in the apartment with the exception of
 Ursa's familar since we literally can't kick it out...and believe me we have all tried incudling Ursa.
 So what does this mourn decide to do? Buy a 120 lb dog and attempt to hide it from me...in my and Ursa's room!
 He then attempted to distract us from going into our room by trashing the kitchen, bathroom and almost throwing a toaster out the window before we got him on the demon trap rug
